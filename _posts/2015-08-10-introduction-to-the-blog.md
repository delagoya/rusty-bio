description: An introduction to the blog.

This blog will cover a fairly useless topic, which is me learning to program in the [Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org). The twist is that the subject matter examples will revolve around bioinformatics, which is to say file parsing, regular expressions, and pipeline building, not so much the computational biology and algorithms bit. 

So come for the bad writing, stay for ... well its a work in progress.
