description: An introduction to the blog.

This blog will cover a fairly useless topic, which is me (re)learning to program in bioinformatics, first with the [Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org). Bioinformatics is split into two major areas (as far as I am concerned): one that has a lot of file parsing, regular expressions, and pipeline building;  and the other is more computational biology and algorithms focused. My inclination is that the Rust will be more well-suited to writing the kernels of functions, as well as job distribution, but we shall see. 

So come for the bad writing, stay for ... well its a work in progress.
