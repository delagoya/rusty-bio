Other than [a good text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (please don't email me about [some](https://macromates.com/) [other](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [editor](http://www.vim.org/)) and *nix terminal, you will need a few items, not the least of which is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Since I am on a Mac, I use the excellent [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Rust: 

```shell
brew install rust
```
