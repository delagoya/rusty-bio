# rusty-bio

A small site for me to write about learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) in the context of [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) problems.

Development happens on the [gh-pages] branch. 

Find the site at http://delagoya.github.io/rusty-bio


## Colophon

This site uses a simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog to create the articles over time. Maybe one day it will be collected into something more, but for now, this will suffice.
