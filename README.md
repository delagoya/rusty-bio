# rusty-bio

A small site for me to write about learning [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) in the context of [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) problems.

## Colophon

This site uses a simple [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog to create the articles over time. Maybe one day it will be collected into something more, but for now, this will suffice.
